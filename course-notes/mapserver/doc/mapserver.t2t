= Introducing Mapserver with QGIS =

== What is it? ==

```
MapServer is an Open Source platform for publishing spatial data and 
interactive mapping applications to the web. Originally developed in 
the mid-1990â€™s at the University of Minnesota, MapServer is released 
under an MIT-style license, and runs on all major platforms (Windows, 
Linux, Mac OS X).

   -- http://mapserver.org/
```

In this tutorial we will show you how to work with QGIS and mapserver to:

 + generate mapfiles
 + test mapfiles
 + use mapserver as a portrayal service for maps and QGIS as a client (via wms)
 +


== Installation ==

We assume you have QGIS installed already. To install mapserver under ubuntu do :

```
sudo apt-get install cgi-mapserver python-mapscript
```


The python mapscript module above is not strictly needed - 
it will be used for testing our map files.

For the above mentioned testing, you should also install mapfile 
tools plugin using the QGIS python plugin manager (you need to 
enable 3rd party repositories first).

== Installing some test data into PostGIS ==

```
#!/bin/bash
createdb mapserver
createlang plpgsql mapserver
psql mapserver < /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/contrib/postgis-1.5/postgis.sql
psql mapserver < /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/contrib/postgis-1.5/spatial_ref_sys.sql
```

Now load our sample datasets:

```
pg_restore country.dmp | mapserver
pg_restore cities.dmp | mapserver
```

Now create a non-privaledged user for use from mapserver:

```
create role ms_readonly with password 'ms_readonly' LOGIN;
```

And assign read permissions to the tables we imported:

```
grant select on cities to ms_readonly;
grant select on country to ms_readonly;
grant select on geometry_columns to ms_readonly;
```

== Creating a connection to the database in QGIS ==

Open QGIS and create a new postgres connection to your mapserver database using
your readonly account. 

```
Layer -> Add PostGIS Layer -> New 
```

And then configure it to look like this:

[doc/img/image01.jpeg]

Now connect to your database. You may get an error like the one below, which
you can safely ignore - it appears because we (purposely) gave the ms_readonly
account limited permissions.

[doc/img/image02.jpeg]

Once you have connected, open the countries and cities layers in QGIS:

[doc/img/image03.jpeg]

Which should open with some random colours like this:


[doc/img/image04-thumb.jpeg]

""Note:"" Make sure that both layers are using 'Old Symbology'!

== Making your first map file ==

What is a map file? A map file is a simple text file that defines the options
that you want mapserver to use when rendering your maps. It specifies the
extents of your project, Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS), which map layers
to use and what symbology to use for them. In many respects, it is just like a
QGIS project file, but for web mapping.

Lets dive right in! We are going to use two plugins to help us do our work.
First install the Mapfile Tools plugin in QGIS (you must enabled 3rd party repositories first).

[doc/img/image05.jpeg]

Next use the plugin manager to enable the mapserver export tool - which we will
use to create your initial map file. 

[doc/img/image06.jpeg]

Save your qgis project - I called mine world.qgs and I placed it in a directory structure like this:

```
/home/web/mapserver-tut/
`-- qgis-projects
    `-- world.qgs
```

Now run the mapserver export plugin:

```
Plugins -> Mapserver Export -> Mapserver Export
```

Accept the default options and save your map file. I have placed mine here:

```
mapserver-tut/
|-- mapfiles
|   `-- world.map    <-- new map file created
`-- qgis-projects
    `-- world.qgs
```

""Note:"" The directory where you place the map file and the map file itself
must be accessible to the apache www-data user.

[doc/img/image08.jpeg]

After the export you will see a message with some tips like this:

[doc/img/image09.jpeg]


Before it can be used, the map file as exported needs a few tweaks. Open it
using your favourite editor e.g.

```
Accessories -> gedit
```

Now comment out the following lines by placing a hash before them:

```
 # FONTSET './fonts/fonts.txt'
 # SYMBOLSET './symbols/symbols.txt'
```

And near the bottom comment out the line:

```
 # SYMBOL "circle"
```          

We will explain why we commented them out just now, but first lets test our 
new map service!

== Testing ==

The first thing I usually do when I set up a new map service is to test it. In
this section we show the different ways you can manually contruct a request to
the server. Although you won't use these on a day to day basis, understanding
them can be very useful for diagnostics. If the service does not return the
expected results, you can issue these low level commands and look at the xml
documents returned to try to identify any inconsistencies. Also mapserver will
sometimes add comments for you to the document indicating where the service
specification can be improved.

You will see later on in the trouble shooting section, that watching the apache
logs to see which requests are being issued by your client (and if neccessary
replaying those requests in your browser) can also help you to identify issues
in your application architecture.

=== GetCapabilities ===

Your first port of call should be to issue a get capabilities request like this:

```
http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/home/web/mapserver-tut/mapfiles/
world.map&request=getCapabilities&service=wms&version=1.1.0
```

""Note:"" For formatting purposes I will be breaking up urls into multiple
lines in this tutorial, but you should write them into your browser location
bar as a single line.

    </Layer>
  </Capability>
</WMT_MS_Capabilities>
```

The capabilities document is a machine and human readable declaration from your
map service describing all the things it can do. In this case it can:

- Provide its name and title ""QGIS-MAP"".
- Provide the contact details of the person responsible for the service if any.
- Describe its capabilities and by which protocols (HTTP) they are available in
  response to a ""GetCapabilities"" request (as listed above).
- Provide a map (in various image formats) in response to a ""GetMap"" request.
- Provide information about a given feature in response to a ""GetFeatureInfo"" request.
- Provide details about one or more layers in response to a ""DescribeLayer"" request.
- The document ends with a listing of all the layers available for the service.
- 






=== DescribeLayer ===

The purpose of the describe layer request is to get a description for one or more
layers offered by the map service:

```
http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/home/web/mapserver-tut/mapfiles/world.map&
request=DescribeLayer&service=wms&version=1.3.0&layers=Country&sld_version=1.1.0
```

Which produces something like:

```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<DescribeLayerResponse xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/sld"
  xmlns:ows="http://www.opengis.net/ows" xmlns:se="http://www.opengis.net/se"
  xmlns:wfs="http://www.opengis.net/wfs"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opengis.net/sld
  http://schemas.opengis.net/sld/1.1.0/DescribeLayer.xsd">
<Version>1.1.0</Version>
  <LayerDescription>
    <owsType>wfs</owsType>
    <se:OnlineResource xlink:type="simple" 
      xlink:href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv?
      map=/home/web/mapserver-tut/mapfiles/world.map"/>
    <TypeName>
      <se:FeatureTypeName>Country</se:FeatureTypeName>
    </TypeName>
  </LayerDescription>
</DescribeLayerResponse>
```

It doesn't tell us too much because there are not many properties defined for the layer at this stage.

=== GetMap ===

No doubt you have been waiting for this part - the part where we actually make
a map:

```
http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/home/web/mapserver-tut/mapfiles/world.map&SERVICE=WMS&
VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX=-86.962482,-182.818000,111.102000,194.678000&
CRS=EPSG:4326&WIDTH=1561&HEIGHT=819&LAYERS=Cities,Country&STYLES=,&
FORMAT=image/png&DPI=96&TRANSPARENT=true
```

It should return a pretty picture something like this:


[doc/img/image10.jpeg]

== Testing with QGIS ==

=== Create a new WMS Connection ===

You can use QGIS as a WMS client - it will display the rendered map just like
any other layer.

```
Layer -> Add WMS Layer -> New
```

And then define your new WMS layer source as:

""Name:" Localhost World
"Url:"   
```http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv?
   map=/home/web/mapserver-tut/mapfiles/world.map```


[doc/img/image11.jpeg]

=== Adding a layer ===

Now select 'Localhost World' from your connections list and click 'connect'.

Then select the top level item on the tree then click 'add':


[doc/img/image12.jpeg]

You should see the same layer we saw previously in the web browser, but now 
rendered in QGIS. But now you can pan and zoom around in the layer!

[doc/img/image13.jpeg]


== Beautifying you map ==

The process we followed above is an easy way to get started, but it is just 
that a starting point - from here on we will be manually editing the mapfile 
and creating symbol files etc.

You might have noticed that the cities layer doesnt really show up (in fact
they are there but drawn as single black pixels). This is because we have not
yet made a proper symbol for them. In this step we will show you how to define
a new symbol and assign it to the cities layer.

=== Creating a symbol definition ===

To start with we need to create a neat directory structure for our symbols, so
we will add a new directory so our tree looks like this:

```
mapserver-tut/
|-- mapfiles
|   |-- symbols
|   |   `-- symbols.sym
|   `-- world.map
`-- qgis-projects
    `-- world.qgs
```

So under the mapfiles directory, you need to create the symbols directory, and
then create a text file called symbols.sym using your text editor. Now add the
following to that file:

```
SYMBOLSET
  SYMBOL
    NAME 'circle'
    TYPE ELLIPSE
    FILLED TRUE
    POINTS
      1 1 
    END 
  END 
END
```

We have created a simple symbolset and defined one symbol called 'circle' as an
ellipse with radius and flattening equal (so it will make a perfect circle).

Now lets uncomment and tweak a few lines in our map file that I had you comment
out before:

Uncomment your symbolset line near the top of the map file and make it look like this:

```
SYMBOLSET './symbols/symbols.sym'
```


Uncomment at around line 120:

```
         SYMBOL "circle"
```         

Now refresh your map view in QGIS and you should see something like this:

[doc/img/image14.jpeg]

The symbolset file is used to define any symbols you want to use. The process
of creating symbols is described in the
[http://mapserver.org/mapfile/symbol.html Mapserver Symbol Reference] and the
[http://mapserver.org/mapfile/symbology/construction.html construction of
cartographic symbols reference].

=== Creating multiple classes for a layer ===

Sometimes you want to do things like assign multiple symbols to a layer based
on an attribute. For example, lets make our cities vary in size based on the
population they host.

In QGIS I can load the cities layer and then create graduated symbology for it
(make sure you are using the 'old' symbology) based on the population.

[doc/img/image15.jpeg]

When you click ok, your map should now look like this:

[doc/img/image16.jpeg]

Now save your project and run the mapserver export tool again, but this time
tick the 'LAYER information only' box and set the map file name to a temporary
file e.g. /tmp/test.map. Doing this will create a map file with only layer
definitions in it, which we can then use to overwrite the existing cities layer
definition in our map file:

[doc/img/image17.jpeg]

Now use a text editor to cut the 'cities' layer definition from the
/tmp/test.map file you made and overwrite the cities definition in the
world.map file with it.

So this:

```
  LAYER
    NAME 'Cities'
    TYPE POINT
    DUMP true
    TEMPLATE fooOnlyForWMSGetFeatureInfo
  EXTENT -182.818000 -86.052507 194.678000 111.102207
    CONNECTIONTYPE postgis
    CONNECTION "dbname='mapserver' host=localhost port=5432 user='ms_readonly' password='ms_readonly' sslmode=disable"
    DATA 'the_geom FROM "cities" USING UNIQUE gid USING srid=4326'
    FILTER ( GeometryType("the_geom") IN ('POINT','MULTIPOINT') )
    METADATA
      'ows_title' 'Cities'
    END
    STATUS OFF
    TRANSPARENCY 100
    PROJECTION
    'proj=longlat'
    'ellps=WGS84'
    'datum=WGS84'
    'no_defs'
    END
    CLASS
       NAME 'Cities' 
       STYLE
         SYMBOL "circle" 
         SIZE 7.0 
         OUTLINECOLOR 0 0 0
         COLOR 0 0 0
       END
    END
  END
```

Gets replaced with this:

```
  LAYER

    TYPE POINT
    DUMP true
    TEMPLATE fooOnlyForWMSGetFeatureInfo

    END
  END

```

There are two important changes here. Firstly the 'CLASSITEM' option was added
that tells mapserver which field we are going to classify cities by. Secondly,
each CLASS has an EXPRESSION defined which designates the upper and lower
limits for that class.


Lets add our mapserver layer back into QGIS and test what the result looks like:

[doc/img/image18.jpeg]

=== Now you try ===

Use the techniques we have learned above to create distinct classes on the
country layer based on the population size in each country. We want to achieve
something like this:

[doc/img/image19.jpeg]


== An exercise ==

Lets recap what we have learned so for by adding another layer to our project.
This time we will add roads to our map so that we have some line features to
work with.

+ Use the supplied roads.dmp to load the roads layer into your database
+ Set the permissions on the roads table so that the ms_readonly user has access to it
+ Add the roads layer to your GIS project twice
+ Give the first layer a scale visibility range of 500000 to 5000000 
+ Give the second layer a scale visibility range of 0 to 500000
