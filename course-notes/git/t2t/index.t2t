= Working with GIT = 

This document provides a simple introduction to working with git. GIT is a
distributed source code management (SCM) system. Although this is a source code
management system, you can use it for **any** type of documents that you want
to version control and / or work on collaboratively with others.

If you are familiar with SVN, GIT is quite similar but adds some new concepts.
In particular, GIT is distributed, which means there doesnt have to be one
single repository that you work against. GIT also is ideal for offline work
where you still want to do version control. We will explore this more as we go
on.

== Installation ==

Installing GIT is easy. Under linux, install like this:

```
sudo apt-get install git meld gitg
```

The latter two are not actually needed but will prove useful later.

Under windows you can use msysgit - notes on using msys git are provided
further down in this document.


== Quick Start ==

I would like to plunge in with a quick start to using git and then come back to
a more systematic coverage of the tool. The idea is to get you familiar with
the concepts in the following diagram:

[img/git-basic-workflow.png]

=== Create a local repository === 

We start off by creating a local repository. A local repository resides on your
own hard dist (its just a directory with some special hidden files in it), and
allows you to do all normal SCM activities - check out code, make changes,
commit, review your history and so on. We will just make a new directory and
initialise it as a git repository:

```
cd dev
mkdir git-sandbox
cd git-sandbox
git init
```

Ok now we have a repository, lets do some work in it.

=== Adding a file to the repository ===

To version any files in the repository, you just need to copy them into your
directory (in our example it is called git-sandbox) or create them. Let's
create a file called README:

```
gedit README
```

or

```
vim README
```

Now we will write a little text to the file:

```
Hello world from my sandbox
```

Then save and close the file. We can use the git //status// command to see the
status of our repository:

```
git status
```

Which will return something like this:

```
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	README
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

It tells us that we have one untracked file - the README file we just created.
So how do we start tracking the file?

```
git add README
```

Now //git status// will show the file as tracked:



```
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	new file:   README
#

```

Ok, now you can commit your file:

```
git commit -m "First version of README"
[master (root-commit) 7ea07e1] First version of README
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 README
```

The //-m// option is used to specify the commit message. If you don't provide a
//-m// option, git will prompt you for a message using a simple text editor.
Once the file is committed, your repository will have a nice clean status:

```
git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

Let's make a small change to the README file:

```
Hello world from my sandbox - I'm using GIT!
```

Git status will show that the file is now modified: 

```
# On branch master
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   README
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

This change is **unstaged** - it wont be included in your next commit unless
you add it.

```
git add README
```

Now its status is set to **staged** - it will be included in the next commit
you make.

```
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	modified:   README
#

```

Finally you can commit your change using the commit command again:

```
git commit -m "Improved the README"
[master 983f6fd] Improved the README
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
```

Did you notice that odd looking number in the output? 983f6fd is shortened
version of the unique SHA-1 hash assigned to that commit. Each commit you make
will be assigned such an identifier. The commit numbers are not sequential
numbers like SVN has. The reason for this is that the commits need to be
globally unique in a distributed repository environment (which we will explore
later).

We will finish off our quick start tour by running a few interesting commands
on our repository:

```
git log README 
commit 983f6fda163c09094ef6939b7d4db4af1bfa8c3c
Author: Tim Sutton <tim@linfiniti.com>
Date:   Mon May 9 23:04:08 2011 +0200

    Improved the README

commit 7ea07e1d1e029510a258efebc8cc170cb685803c
Author: Tim Sutton <tim@linfiniti.com>
Date:   Mon May 9 16:35:37 2011 +0200

    First version of README

```

The //git log// command shows you the history of commits made for a file (most
recent changes are shown above older changes). You can see we have made two
commits to this file, and the message associated with each commit.

Finally, lets look at the difference between these two commits:

```
git diff 7ea07e1 983f6 README
diff --git a/README b/README
index 2d564aa..d85ea56 100644
--- a/README
+++ b/README
@@ -1 +1 @@
-Hello from my sandbox
+Hello from my sandbox - I'm using GIT!
```

You can see the two options I passed to the diff command are shortened versions
of the SHA-1 hashes assigned to each commit. You can also see that the text in
my README file was augmented with the phrase "I'm using GIT!".

Hopefully this quick look at git has given you the basic concept. In the
sections that follow we will explore with more detail some of the other things
you can do with GIT.


== Git Workflows ==

In this section we are going to walk you through various scenarios to show you
how git can be used effectively.

=== Repository Clones ===

You can create your repository in one of two ways:

+ Initialise a new one
+ Clone an existing one
+

We already created our own repository using the 'quick start' section above.
Let us see how you can clone the repository we made earlier (we will assume
that you are still in the **git-sandbox** directory at this time):

```
cd ..
git clone git-sandbox git-sandbox-clone
```

You should see a message like this:

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/git-sandbox-clone/.git/
```

Now if we enter the cloned repository, we can work in it just like we worked in
the original directory. Lets run that //git log// command again:

```
[git-sandbox-clone] git log
commit 983f6fda163c09094ef6939b7d4db4af1bfa8c3c
Author: Tim Sutton <tim@linfiniti.com>
Date:   Mon May 9 23:04:08 2011 +0200

    Improved the README

commit 7ea07e1d1e029510a258efebc8cc170cb685803c
Author: Tim Sutton <tim@linfiniti.com>
Date:   Mon May 9 16:35:37 2011 +0200

    First version of README

```

You can see our clone has exactly the same commit history as the original
repository has - it is an exact clone of the original. Let's make another
change to our README file and commit it. I'm going to add this line:

```
This line was added in the cloned repository.
```

And then //git add// and //git commit// my changes:

```
git add README
git commit -m "Added a line while in my cloned repo"
```

Which produces output like this:

```
[master 218dfa8] Added a line while in my cloned repo
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
```

Now run the //git log// command again and look at the output:

```
[git-sandbox-clone] git log README
commit 218dfa8474c3213b1a77973df8739ed75120bde5
Author: Tim Sutton <tim@linfiniti.com>
Date:   Mon May 9 23:31:21 2011 +0200

 Added a line while in my cloned repo

commit 983f6fda163c09094ef6939b7d4db4af1bfa8c3c
Author: Tim Sutton <tim@linfiniti.com>
Date:   Mon May 9 23:04:08 2011 +0200

 Improved the README

commit 7ea07e1d1e029510a258efebc8cc170cb685803c
Author: Tim Sutton <tim@linfiniti.com>
Date:   Mon May 9 16:35:37 2011 +0200

 First version of README
```

Well done - you cloned the repository and make a change in your local copy.

== Git conflicts =

Lets go back to our original repository and update the readme file with a new change:

```
cd ../git-sandbox
gedit README
```

And add this line:

```
This is a change in the original.
```

Now commit your changes and return to the clone directory:

```
[git-sandbox] git add README
git commit -m "A new update from the original repo"
cd ../git-sandbox-clone
```

Now we will merge any changes made in the original repo into our clone:

```
[git-sandbox-clone] git pull
Auto-merging README
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

```

What happened? Git pulled in the changes made in the original repo, but detected that 
the same line had been changed in both the original repo and the clone, so it 
doesn't know how to combine them. We can help git to resolve the issues by running //git mergetool//.

```
[git-sandbox-clone] git mergetool
merge tool candidates: meld opendiff kdiff3 tkdiff xxdiff tortoisemerge
           gvimdiff diffuse ecmerge p4merge araxis vimdiff emerge
Merging the files: README

Normal merge conflict for 'README':
  {local}: modified
    {remote}: modified
    Hit return to start merge resolution tool (meld):
```

When you press enter a graphical user interface will appear (if you are on
linux) which looks something like this.:

[img/image01.jpeg]

The merge tool shows a side by side view of the version or README in your 
local repository (clone) and the version of README. Alternatively you can
simply open the README in a text editor and resolve the differences. Here 
is another example of where a merge conflict occurs (before resolving):

```
Hello from my sandbox  - I'm using GIT!
This is a change in the original.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Local Change
=======
Yet another change
>>>>>>> 1386adb6b1b6131d64d18f2bffa877a6687b0073
```

And then after editing the conflicted file it might look like this:


```
Hello from my sandbox  - I'm using GIT!
This is a change in the original.
Local Change
Yet another change
```

Once you have created the final version, you need to commit to indicate to 
GIT that the conflict has been resolved. Doing a //git status// will show 
you what needs to be committed:

```
[git-sandbox-clone] git status
# On branch master
# Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
# and have 1 and 1 different commit(s) each, respectively.
#
# Unmerged paths:
#   (use "git add/rm <file>..." as appropriate to mark resolution)
#
#   both modified:      README
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#   README.orig
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

So to finalise the conflict resolution, we can commit our change:

```
[git-sandbox-clone] git add README
[git-sandbox-clone] git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts on README"
[master ed30a38] Resolved merge conflicts on README
```

**Sidebar:** We learnt something else new in this section: When we have 
a clone of repository, you can synchronise it with the changes in 
the original repository by doing //git pull//. In our simple sandbox example, 
the two repositories are just two directories in the same file system, 
though GIT supports synchronising repositories over a network connection 
too, which is commonly how it is used.

== Git Topologies ==

Git is a distributed versioning system. That means there doesnt't have to be 
one single source for the repository. You can define the topology for your project 
in a way that is most convenient to you. 

== Central Repository ==

If you work in a small team, you may adopt a centralised repository model,
similar to SVN. Actually it is a bit of a misnomer, since each client who
checks out the repo obtains a copy (with all its version history) on their
local machine. This is unlike SVN where you check out only a **snapshot** of
the current state of the code. In SVN, any time you want to refer back to an
older commit, you need to query the central repository over the network. In GIT
you have a full copy of the repository stored locally so that network
connection is not required. Similarly, with SVN, if you want to commit a
change, you need to have a network connection to the repository. Under GIT
however you commit to your local repository first and then push your changes up
to the central repository when you have a connection available. This makes git
great for working away from the office, on the plane etc. You just work as per
normal and when you get connected to the internet again, you simply sync (push)
your local changes too the //origin// repository.

**Sidebar:** One huge advantage of GIT is that you inherantly have a full historised 
backup for each person who has cloned the repo. If the central repo should be lost, you 
can simply reinstate it from any of the clones on your developer's desktops.

The workflow (as shown in the illustration below) when working with a central 
repository is simple:

+ Clone the repository initially
+ Make local changes and add them
+ Commit those changes locally
+ Push your changes up to the central repo
+

== Heirarchical Topology ==

In larger teams, or where you have subteams working on different areas of your 
code base, you may wish to adopt a heirarchical model - also called the 'captain 
and luitenants model'.

[img/placeholder.png]

In this arrangement, there is one person (the 'captain') who performs the final 
integration into the official repository. Under the 'captain', various 


== Git under windows ==

Here are some generic notes on using git under windows you should install [msys
git app http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/]. In windows explorer go to
c:\Documents and Settings\<your user>\

Make a directory called .ssh

In that directory create a text file called 'config' (note it has no extension)
and put the following content into it:

```
Host <host name>
  User <user name>
  HostName <host name>
  Port <port>
```

Replace items in angle brackets above as appropriate.

Now copy your id_dsa into this directory (it should be a unix style one so you
may need to convert from putty style private key, though just try with your
existing one first).

Open the msys git shell then go to the directory where you want to check out
your project to. For example to check it out to c:\dev\foo do

```
cd /c/
mkdir dev
cd dev
```

Now clone the directory:
```
git clone git@foo:bar.git bar
```

Make sure to type 'yes' in full when it asks you if you are sure you want to
continue connecting.

Then enter your passphrase when prompted.

Wait a few minutes while it checks out.

Thereafter you use the git commands from the msys shell as normal. There is
also a tortoisegit explorer integration for windows you can try but I havent
used it and don't know how well it works.
