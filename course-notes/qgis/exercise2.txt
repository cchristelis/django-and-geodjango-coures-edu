Set the CRS to UTM 34 S

Add in the roads and rivers layers

Define styles for each layer:
 - classify roads by type and use a variation of an overlay style for each class
 - create an offset shadow behind your rivers
 - save the style definitions so that they can be reused later

Add the roads in again, and create a query / subset definition so that it only shows streets and minor roads.

Set the first road layer to only be visible between 100000 and 100000000
Set the second road layer to be only visible between 0 and 100000

Configure labels for the roads layer that is shown at a large scale

Create a new line layer with attributes:
 - name (text)
 - type (number)

Use the attribute properties to create a value map for each field

Configure snapping so that the line layer is snapped to roads and rivers

Capture 5 new features.

Create a buffer around each line feature of 500m

Select all roads that intersect the buffer

Create a map composition showing the roads that intersect your buffers and add traditional map elements - scale bar, north arrow, etc.
